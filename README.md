# DAT076/DIT127 - Web development project
Welcome to this full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, and Express, with Axios for API requests. This project showcases skills in building scalable and efficient web applications using industry-standard tools and frameworks. The application provides ability for two users to be matched with each other based on their food choices. To get started, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the server. Enjoy!


## Project Description
This project is called FoodMatcher. The idea of this web project is to create a website where two users can be matched with each other based on their food choices. The idea is heavily inspired by the traditional Tinder app which maps users with each other. In this project, however, users will be matched based on their food preferences. A user will be able to like or dislike a dish that is shown to them and will be matched with another user only if they have both liked the same food. The users will be able to form groups in the application, where the matching is occuring. Multiple users within the same group will therefore be matched based on which dish they like/dislike.

## How to run

#### Introduction:
These instructions will guide you through running our full stack website using React, TypeScript, Bootstrap and CSS for the frontend, and TypeScript, Node.js, and Express for the backend. The server and client sides are separated into two different folders. By the end of these instructions, you will have successfully started the server and client sides of the application, and be able to interact with the website on your local machine.

#### Instructions:

* Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

* Clone or download the repository https://github.com/abbasfaizi/Web-Project-NodeJs.git

* Navigate to the root folder of the project in the terminal or command prompt.

* Run the command "npm install" to install all the required dependencies for both the client and server sides of the application.

* Navigate to the client folder in the terminal or command prompt.

* Run the command "npm start" to start the client side of the application. This will launch your website in your default browser.

* Open a new terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the server folder.

* Run the command "npm run dev" to start the server side of the application in development mode. This will start the server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code.

* Head to http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
