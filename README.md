# DAT076/DIT127 - Web development project
This a web development NodeJs project.


## Project Description
This project is called FoodMatcher. The idea of this web project is to create a website where two users can be matched with each other based on their food choices. The idea is heavily inspired by the traditional Tinder app which maps users with each other. In this project, however, users will be matched based on their food preferences. A user will be able to like or dislike a dish that is shown to them and will be matched with another user only if they have both liked the same food. The users will be able to form groups in the application, where the matching is occuring. Multiple users within the same group will therefore be matched based on which dish they like/dislike.

## How to run

* Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

* Clone or download the repository that contains your website code.

* Navigate to the root folder of the project in the terminal or command prompt.

* Run the command npm install to install all the required dependencies for both the client and server sides of the application.

* Navigate to the client folder in the terminal or command prompt.

* Run the command npm start to start the client side of the application. This will launch your website in your default browser.

* Open a new terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the server folder.

* Run the command npm run dev to start the server side of the application in development mode. This will start the server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code.
